LangChain Prompt Templates allow you to create and manage libraries of prompts.

You can chian prompts together to make them reusable.

Will you create an example of how we could use langchain to manage prompts?

I'm specifically interested in how prompts can be reused by chaining together prompts.

I've created a project scaffold within project_scaffold xml stanza

{{include "../python-package/python-package.tmpl" .}}

<project_scaffold>
{{include "../project-scaffold/project-scaffold.tmpl" .}}
</project_scaffold>
